<p>This guide provides the bare minimum required to get started with Story Ghost.</p>

<p>Create a new story, and select your starting template. All values may be changed later in the Story Properties menu.</p>

<p>All options are available by clicking the "hamburger" menu in the top right corner.</p>

<img class="guide-img-lg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/settings_button-min.png" alt="settings button and editor" />

<p>Access features as needed by toggling display panels. Every panel has a circular button with a "?" inside, which starts a brief on-page guided tour of that panel. Story Ghost has many features, so when you need documentation on a specific one, you have easy access to the specific information you need.</p>

<p>If you prefer a lighter color scheme, you may turn off dark mode in "Colors and Typography."</p>

<p>Each "Page" is a distinct unit of writing, however you determine that. Story Ghost allows you to organize your pages in three ways, with distinct orders and hierarchies. All Pages is the "kitchen sink" of everything - from outline notes to completed chapters. When a page is meant for your readers, click the "Metadata" button to toggle the "is presentation page?" checkbox. If you are writing a nonlinear story, you may <em>optionally</em> designate pages as Temporal, which allows you to order pages chonologically.</p>

<img class="guide-img-lg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/nav_trees-min.png" alt="page navigation" />

<p>Finally, when your story is ready for the world, navigate to Settings -> Story Properties, and toggle the "Make story public?" checkbox.</p>

<img class="guide-img-sm" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/share-min.png" alt="share story" />

<p>This guide only scratches the surface. Click the "?" icon at the top of each panel to learn more about the feature. Please <a href="https://storyghost.ai/contact/">contact us</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p>
