<p>You can change the target word count at any time by clicking on the Settings button.</p>

<img class="guide-img-sm" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/word_count_settings.png" alt="screenshot of settings word count" />

<p>Not all chapters have the same pacing targets. Below the main text area, we display [current chapter word count] / [suggested chapter word count].</p>

<img class="guide-img-lg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/word_count_example.png" alt="screenshot of word count per chapter" />

<p>By default, the main writing area, Inspiration panel, and Structure Prompts panel are displayed. Hidden are the Log Line panel, and the Characters Panel. In the Panels menu, you can toggle visibility of any panel.</p>

<img class="guide-img-sm" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/panel_visibility_settings.png" alt="screenshot of panel visibility toggle" />

<p>Click on Chapters to switch the current chapter. Story Ghost is opinionated - we use the Save The Cat method to break the story into 16 chapters, which informs the advice prompts you'll see in the Structure Prompts panel.</p>

<img class="guide-img-sm" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/chapter_toggle.png" alt="screenshot of Chapter toggle" />

<p>The Inspiration panel contains the following elements: current context, Autocomplete, Rephraser, Image Thesaurus. The Rephraser and Image Thesaurus work best with single sentences, or short snippets of text, while the Autocomplete works best with much longer textual context. As you highlight text, or set your cursor to different positions in your writing, notice how the two context fields automatically update. When you click the "Get Inspiration" button, this is the textual context that is sent to each respective feature.</p>

<p>At this point, if you are a "pantser" then get writing!</p>

<p>If you are more of a "plotter", then use the Panels menu to hide the Inspiration and Structure Prompts tab. Enable the Characters and Log Line panels. Scroll through the options in these panels and fill them out to match as closely as possible to the story you have in mind. It's ok if things don't perfectly match.</p>

<img class="guide-img-lg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/character_and_logline.png" alt="screenshot of Character and Log Line" />

<p>Use the Panels menu to hide the Characters and Log Line panel, and show the Structure Prompts panel. Click the chapter advice button to expand it. This provides starter advice that you can copy into the Outline text area and refine into a summary of events and goals for the chapter. Use the Chapters menu to do this for each of your 16 chapters.</p>

<img class="guide-img-sm" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guide/structure_prompt_example.png" alt="screenshot of Structure Prompts" />

<p>Toggle on the Inspiration panel, and start writing! Use the Structure Outline to remind you of the chapter's focus. Use the Inspiration tab to quickly generate ideas in support of your Outline goals. Keep an eye on the word count target to compress or expand your writing to meet overall pacing targets.</p>

<p>Finally, use the Settings menu item to enable the "Is Public" checkbox. Click the "View Story" button, which will open a new window, and share the URL with your beta readers.</p>
