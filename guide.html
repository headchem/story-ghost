<p>TIP: to set the mood and minimize distractions, most desktop browsers have a full-screen mode. Typically, you can press the "F11" to quickly toggle full-screen mode.</p>

<p>You can change this value at any time. It is only used to provide a helpful word counter for each chapter. Not all chapters have the same pacing targets, so we'll do the math for you, and display [current chapter word count] / [suggested chapter word count].</p>

<p>Create the story. By default, the main writing area, Inspiration panel, and Structure panel are displayed. Hidden are the Log Line panel, and the Characters Panel. In the Panels menu, you can toggle visibility of the panels.</p>

<p>Click on Chapters to switch the current chapter. Story Ghost is opinionated - we use the Save The Cat method to break the story into 16 chapters, which informs the advice prompts you'll see in the Structure panel.</p>

<p>The Inspiration panel contains the following elements: current context, Autocomplete, Rephraser, Image Thesaurus.
TODO: explain more about how to use this</p>

<p>At this point, if you are a "pantser" then get writing!</p>

<p>If you are more of a "plotter", then use the Panels menu to hide the Inspiration and Structure tab for now. Now enable the Characters and Log Line panels. Scroll through the options in these panels and fill them out to match as close as possible to the story you have in mind. It's ok if things don't perfectly match.</p>

<p>Use the Panels menu to hide the Characters and Log Line panel, and show the Structure panel. Click the chapter advice button to expand it. This provides advice that you can choose to use in the Outline text area, which are your author's notes for a summary of events and goals you have for the chapter. Use the Chapters menu to do this for each of your 16 chapters.</p>

<p>Toggle on the Inspiration panel, and start writing! Use the Structure Outline to remind you of the chapter's focus. Use the Inspiration tab to quickly generate ideas in support of your Outline goals. Keep an eye on the word count target to compress or expand your writing to meet overall pacing targets.</p>

<p>Finally, use the Settings menu item to enable the "Is Public" checkbox. Click the "View Story" button and share with your beta readers.</p>
